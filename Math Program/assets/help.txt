Math Match is a game designed to test and practice algebra skills.
 
Upon starting the game you will be presented with a set of algebraic 
equations on buttons. Each equation is part of a pair, in which both 
equations share the same value of x. Your objective is to match up 
these equations. To match them up, click on two buttons that have 
the same x value. If your match is correct, you'll be awarded points. 
If you get it wrong the match wont be set and you will lose points.
